## Features NOT Implemented

Per the issue requirement to prioritize "one fully working feature over two partially working":

### Text-to-Speech (TTS) - Not Implemented
**Reason:** Requires external Replicate API integration, adds complexity

### Speech-to-Text (STT) - Not Implemented
**Reason:** Requires external Replicate API integration, adds complexity

### Dynamic Model Selection - Not Implemented
**Reason:** Complex feature requiring OpenRouter API queries and constraint parsing

These features were intentionally skipped to focus on delivering production-ready, fully tested features.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Activating Pirate Profile
```
User: /activate pirate
Bot: Profile 'pirate.profile' activated successfully.
Bot: Ahoy there, matey! I be Captain ChatBot, ready to help ye navigate 
     the seven seas of knowledge! What treasure of information be ye seeking today? ‚öìüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

User: What is gravity?
Bot: Arr! Gravity be the force that pulls ye down to the deck, matey! 
     'Tis what keeps yer boots on the ship and prevents ye from floatin' 
     off into the heavens like a wayward seagull! ...
```

### Example 2: Math Tutoring with LaTeX
```
User: /activate tutor_ib
Bot: Profile 'tutor_ib.profile' activated successfully.
Bot: Hello! I'm your IB Math and Physics tutor. I'm here to help you 
     understand concepts deeply, not just memorize formulas. What would 
     you like to work on today? üìö

User: Explain the quadratic formula
Bot: Great question! The quadratic formula solves equations of this form:
[Image: rendered equation "ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0"]

Bot: The solution is:
[Image: rendered equation "x = (-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤-4ac)) / 2a"]

Bot: Can you tell me what each variable represents?
```

### Example 3: Creating Custom Profile
```
File: profiles/science_teacher.profile
---
gpt-4o
Hello! I'm your science teacher. Let's explore the wonders of science together! üî¨
You are an enthusiastic science teacher who makes complex topics accessible. 
Use analogies, real-world examples, and when appropriate, use LaTeX for 
scientific formulas. Always encourage curiosity and critical thinking.
